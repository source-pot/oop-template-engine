# TemplateEngine todo list
> Because who doesn't like a list of things to do


1. Allow piping of variables into functions, e.g. `{{variable|str_to_upper}}`
2. Create caching of templates to disk to speed up processing of templates for repeat calls
    * The groundwork is present, a template is split into its components when it's created.
      The parsing is a separate process that happens later.
    * Perhaps serializing the Template instance and storing in a file with the template filename?
3. Global data on templates - Set on TemplateEngine then have Templates merge that in when parsing
4. Include files based on variable names. `$data['fileOfChoice' => 'template5.tpl']`,
    `{{@include:fileOfChoice}}`
    * Options:
        - Put real filename in quotes, e.g. `{{@include:"template"}}`
        - Try variable first, fallback to filename
5. Support dot-notation arrays in foreach loops, e.g. `{{@foreach:some.nested.list:value}}` to use
    `$data['some']['nested']['list']` as the array
6. Add decision making.  `{{@if:truthyVariable}}` and `{{@endif:truthyVariable}}`
7. Change end of foreach loop to `{{@endforeach:array}}` to match decision token
8. Switch statement?  `{{@switch:variable}}` with `{{@case:value}}` where `variable === value`.
    Use `{{@endcase}}` and `{{@endswitch}}` tokens to end those blocks
